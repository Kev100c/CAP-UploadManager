# CAP-UploadManager

This mod for Upload Labs adds an upload manager. The manager has 10 slots, each of which can be assigned a priority. The higher the priority, the sooner the file will be uploaded.

Files with the highest priority are uploaded first. If several files have the same priority, they are uploaded in parallel, which increases the upload time. The upload speed is divided equally among all files, which means that smaller files are uploaded faster.
